	<description>A relative unit of measure that is defined by the width of one pixel on the current output device. The absolute size of a pixel is defined by the respective device and should correlate to 
			physical size of a pixel in that device. That might, though, not be possible for all devices (e.g., for beamers where the physical size depends in the distance to the screen).</description>

	<example>
		<code>
			branch {
				line-width: 1px;
			}
		</code>
		<description>Sets the width of all branches in the tree to 1 px. The physical branch widths will then depend on the output device that displays the tree.</description>
