	<description>A relative unit of measure that is defined by the font size of the parent element. (Note that parent element in that case means other simple selectors that reference parent elements
			of the current element. Therefore "tree" would be parent of "node". "Parent" is meant with respect to the tree topology here, which means "node" is never parent to "node".)</description>

	<example>
		<code>
			canvas {
				font-size: 12pt;
			}
			
			node {
				font-size: 0.8rem;
			}
		</code>
		<description>Defines a default font size of 12 pt for the tree and sets the font size of all nodes to 80 % of that (9.6 pt). Note that nodes nested under other nodes will not have an even smaller font size.</description>
